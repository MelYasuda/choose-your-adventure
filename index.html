              <p class="panel panel-default">“Look, Dad! What's that dark cloud over there? It's not the storm, is it?” Looking over the backs of the
              four horses that pull your cart, your father squints, then says, “Riders. Lots of them and coming fast.”
              “Are they bandits, Paul?” asks your mother fearfully, clutching her shawl to her throat. “No, Martha.
              They can't be bandits. The Dwarven Guard cleaned up the last of them then years ago. I don't know
              who they are, but the way they're riding we'll soon find out. “Galen, grab that puppy of yours and get
              under cover in that pile of bedclothes.” “But I want to stay here. If there's trouble, I can help too.” “Do
              as your father says,” snaps your mother. “And don't come out till we say it's safe.” You know better
              than to argue with your mother, so you get off the narrow wooden seat and wriggle through the
              crowded cart. “Well, no one said I couldn't watch,” you whisper to Woofy, who licks your face in reply.
              Snuggling down into the pile of blankets, you quiet the puppy, who thinks you're trying to play. Then
              you arrange the blankets so that you can see. Soon, a faint rumble becomes the drumming thunder of
              horses' hoofs. “Hold your team!” demands a harsh voice. “Oh, Paul! It's the Guard!” cries your mother.
              “Thank heavens, we're safe.” Pulling the team to a complete stop, your father calls, “Ho! Guard! What
              is your business with us? We are anxious to camp before the storm breaks. Speak, and let us be on our
              way.” “Do you dare to speak so to the King's Guard?” snarls a menacing voice. “Teach the humans to
              be polite!” urges another of the uniformed dwarves. Your mother clings to your father's arm. Train
              begins to fall. All around you are the sounds of horses. Saddle leather creaks beneath the weight of the
              armored Dwarven Guard, and you feel the presence of unseen riders closing in. “Now, now, lads. Is this
              any way to speak to those we have vowed to protect?” asks a honeyed voice. “Come, let us not be
              hasty. Let's find out how the situation lies. After all, lads, we wouldn't want to make a mistake now,
              would we?” There is a long moment of silence. Then a few voices mutter, “Sneed's right.” “Well, then.
              There we all are. Nice and pleasant,” says Sneed. “Surely all a mistake. But these are lads with quick
              tempers, so please humor us by answering a few questions.” “I'm sure we've done no wrong,” says your
              mother. “What do you want to know?” “Just a few questions, “says Sneed. “Like where you've been
              and where you're going.” “Why, Captain, we're going to the prince's coronation, of course. And as to
              where we've been, we've been mapping. My husband is the royal mapmaker.” “Royal mapmaker, eh?
              Splendid occupation. So useful. And are you traveling alone?” Your father answers quickly, “Yes,
              Captain, quite alone. Just me and the missus.” “All by yourselves. Splendid, just splendid,” Sneed
              beams. “You see, lads, what comes of talking first? Now we know who these fine people are. Avoid
              mistakes, I always say. Now we know they are alone. Seize them!” Before your father can protest,
              heavy hands pull him and your mother from the cart. Your mother screams and your father curses, but
              rough laughter drowns out their cries. “You see, lads. It is as I told you. Who would suspect the king's
              own Dwarven Guard of treachery? No one, until it's far too late. Soon, all that is owed to us for long
              years of protecting humans will be ours. Now, tie these two up. We'll take them back to the caves. A
              mapmaker will be useful to our new kingdom. Soon we will launch our attack, With the price in our
              hands, the kingdom is ours! Drive the wagon int othe rocks and search it for gold and maps. Then burn
              it!”</p>

Waking up, you find yourself covered in snakes longer than your pa is tall. Dang.

<div id="swimForIt66">
  <p>The water carries you down again, the swamp rats clawing and gnawing at you in a panic. They're tossed away in the current, as you bounce off large stones, stronger than the current. You knew if you went to the well too many times, it would come back to bite you. Going to the well too many times, and the swamp rats, both.</p><p>Minutes later, you wash up on shore, sore and winded, but alive. A few minutes more pass before a one-eyebrowed Sandy drifts up in his raft. You climb on just in time to see a mass of white fur in the water, as the swamp rats have gathered together to better float toward you. Taking a loose branch, you help Sandy push off as fast as you can, and soon the white mass of fur in the water grows smaller and smaller, and is soon a distant memory.</p>
  <p>But ahead, you hear the roar of a waterfall, and you rue this relentless, cursed life.</p>
  <button id="jumpLeft" onclick="waterFall70(this.id)">Take on the waterfall, driving the draft off the left edge into the mist, like an invincible creature with no concept of fear or mortality.</button>
  <button id="jumpRight" onclick="waterFall70(this.id)">Or go to the right, which may or may not be totally different than the left side of the watefall. It's not the destination, it's the journey.</button>
  <button id="goToIsland" onclick="waterFall70(this.id)">There is a suspiciously peaceful-looking island in the center of the river. You feel yourself growing more and more into a cynical adult every moment as it grows larger, realizing nothing is this easy, and it's more likely the gods might be testing you than a satisfying solution might present itself so readily.</button>
</div>
<div id="islandProspects18">
  <p>Despite your best judgment, fear of the waterfall drives you to the island. Crashing your raft into the point, you and Sandy clamber up onto the slick-stone shore. No sooner do you gain your footing than the entire island lurches to the side, knocking you over. Ahead of you, an enormous head rises up out of the water and turns to you, its enormous eyes peering down at you. The island begins to look more like a shell by the moment, as its enormous beak clacks and it lets out a shriek that sends you rolling backwards.</p>
  <p>You scream for Sandy to run for it, and the two of you dive back on your raft, landing in the rapids just as the monster disappears from view. Moments pass before it rises back up, facing you this time, you raft drifting closer and closer to the waterfall.</p>
  <button id="waterfall" onclick="islandThing18(this.id)">Test your fate and take your raft off the waterfall.</button>
  <button id="giantSteps84" onclick="islandThing18(this.id)">As you round the subtle bend toward the waterfall, you see how the river splits in two, toward giant steps, rushing down in rapids.</button>
  <button id="monsterChat" onclick="islandThing18(this.id)">You've had enough. You make an intimidation check against the castle-sized snapping turtle.</button>
</div>

<div id="waterFallJumpLeft147">
  <p>The immensity of your bad idea is cushioned by the waterfall not really being that bad. You fall off the ledge and plunge into a warm-water lagoon, your raft and Sandy landing several feet away and bobbing to the surface.</p>
  <p>As Sandy bobs up to the surface, he lets out a shriek that would be the envy of any passing bird of prey. Looking down, you see large, green humanoid hands reaching up out of the water. Panicking and doggy paddling away, you look back and see six lizardmen with royal armor of sorts, looking you in the eye. They invite you into their lair, where they would like to warm you, feed you, and hear your story.</p>
  <p>Just as you agree, you see Sandy climbing out of the lagoon and running off into the trees at a full sprint. You call for him once, then decide he's probably had enough for one adventure, and turn away. Between facing the monster in the river, and going over the waterfall, you feel yourself flush with a newfound confidence. You hold your head high as you follow the lizardguard around the waterfall and into their laier in the mountain side.</p>
  <p>Inside, you are fed a steaming tincture that burns your mouth, and seems to eat through your very being. But soon you are healed of your injuries and pains from the previous day. You think back on everything you've seen, and this is relatively desirable. They hear your tale, and offer to strike down your enemies in exchange for a hearing with the prince, hoping to establish trade and raise the economic prospects for their people.</p>
  <button id="trustLizardmen" onclick="trustLizard(this.id)">You trust the lizardmen and their offer to help you defeat your foes. Of course they can speak to your prince, who you yourself would otherwise not be able to speak to. It will probably work out fine.</button>
  <button id="neverTrustLizardmen" onclick="trustLizard(this.id)">Who are they kidding? Everyone knows Lizardmen are prohibitively dishonest. They're probably just trying to lull you into a false sense of security, so they can eat you. Which they couldn't just do right now if they wanted. It's better to not think about that sort of thing.</button>
</div>

<div id="giantSteps84">
  <p>This was an absolutely terrible idea. Every fall of ten or more feet rattles your very core, and shakes your raft apart. By the third step, the bindings around the logs are coming undone. By the fifth, you are scrambling to hold onto a single log. Sandy screams and disappears into the white waters, and you are plunged into the depths, swept completely out of control as you lose grip on your log and tumble through the water defenselessly.</p>
  <p>As you hit the bottom, you float in the lagoon and peer up at the waterfall that, in retrospect, wasn't that bad. Something stings above your eye, but you hardly feel it, uncomprehending.</p>
  <p>Then, from the depths of the water around you, immensely powerful, green humanoid hands reach up and grab you, lifting you up and carrying you into a cave behind the waterfall.</p>
  <p>Inside, you are fed a steaming tincture that burns your mouth, and seems to eat through your very being. But soon you are awake and fully aware, surrounded by lizard men. You think back on your day, and everything you've seen, and this is relatively desirable. They hear your tale, and offer to strike down your enemies in exchange for a hearing with the prince, hoping to establish trade and raise the economic prospects for their people.</p>

<div id="attackDragon49">
  <p>You sharpen the raft's oar to a brutal point and sneak up on the slumbering beast. It does not occur to you what sort of creature might sleep out in the open, totally alone and unguarded. Letting out a primal, ten-year-old scream, you charge with your makeshift spear. It shatters on contact, splintering into pieces against the armor scales of the beast. You have only a moment to think before it twitches in its sleep, the impact sending you across the width of the river, landing in the silt and mud of the riverbank. As you slowly lose consciousness, you consider that, perhaps, that was a terrible idea and you've thrown away your one chance to save your parents, and your country, from the impending dwarf attack.</p> -->

          <p>Early the next morning you are awakened by the sound of thousands of dwarves marching off to battle. The old dwarf stand forlornly at the mouth of the empty cavern, listening to them go.

          <p>Pulling the horses into the trees at the edge of the road, you hide and wait until thundering hoofs and booming war drums announce Sneed’s arrival.  “Open the gates!” roars Sneed.</p>
          <p>“Go away! It’s not the time!” yells the guard.</p>
          <p>“Open the gate or it will be past time for your head to rest on your neck,” snarls Sneed.</p>
          <p>There is a moment’s silence, and then the guard says in a tiny voice, “Oh, maybe it is time after all. I think I see the sun coming up now.” The large wooden gates creak open, and Sneed and his men thunder through into the sleeping city.</p>
          <p>As soon as the last Dwarf passes through the gates, the three of you mount your horses and follow them. The gate guard glowers own at you and mutters angrily to himself.</p>
          <p>As you creep through the empty city streets, you hear the army roar, “Sneed! Sneed! Sneed! Long live Sneed the Supreme!”</p>
          <p>Suddenly there is a clatter of hoofs and three horses dash by you. Ties to the saddle of one of the horses ia  boy no older than yourself. A small crown rests crookedly on his head and tears streak his cheeks. For one short moment, the boy looks into your eyes—his look filled with despair—and then he is gone.</p>
          <p>Just then, a small bent figure walks by the alley where you are hiding. He rubs his thin hands together and chuckles to himself, “At last, the king is dead, his son captured, soon to be in a dwarves cell, and those meddlesome Boulderbenders out of the way. Now all I have to do is let Sneed rule for a little while. When the time is right, I’ll slip a poison mushroom into the stew. Then it’s King Snively! No more ‘Yes, sir. No, sir’ ever again.”</p>
          <p>“Not if I can help it,” you say, leaping out of the alley. Before Snively can say another word, you bang him on top of the head with a large rock and he falls to the ground with a thud. You drag him into the alley, search his pockets, and discover a large ring of keys.</p>
          <p>“Bork, do you recognize these keys?”</p>
           <p>“Of course. They’re the keys to the dungeon cells,” answers Bork.</p>
          <p>“I thought he’d have them,” you say. “Help me tie him up. I think we should ride back to the caves, rescue the prince and my parents from the prisons, and throw Snively into the deepest dungeon.”</p>
          <p>“It will also give me a chance to talk to my warriors. Once they know I am free, they will revolt. By morning Iron Mountain will be ours and your parents and the prince will be free and safe.”</p>

You can hear the roar and screams of a battle outside, and know it is time to take action. Things have not been so good lately, the past ten years or so, but that's no excuse. It's time to be a <strong>hero</strong>.</p>
      <p>Staggering to your feet, you pulls both suspenders up, securing your trousers. One of the buttons securing the strap on the right shoulder pops off, sending the that suspender dangling down by your leg. But there is no time for that now! There's no time for anything except saving the town you love.</p><p>...Okay, perhaps not <strong>loves</strong>. Perhaps love is a strong word, but...</p><p>No! There's no time for this. You charge out the front door where you find...nothing. The battle has already moved on and left him behind. Maybe it's for the best, you think. You aren't really cut out for being a hero, or you probably would have already been one. Besides, you're a little past your prime, don't have any weapons, no training, you're by yourself...</p>
      <p>But the heroism you felt a moment ago surges back as a fire rises up in the distance. Off you stumble, toward the action!</p>
      <p>To be fair, someone in town should have to put up a sign saying the stones on the bridge are wet. The suspender you lost earlier now wraps around your leg, tripping you, and over the side you go, slowly drifting down river with the current. You watch as city drifts by, with no obvious way to get out. Eventually, you drift out of the city entirely, and by then you're growing used to the river. The temperature isn't bad, after all. As the city drifts away, you think about how this might be for the best anyway.</p>

      <p>As an ancient wizard, great and powerful, you are often asked why you allow wars to continue. As someone of great strength, isn't it your obligation to offer protection to the helpless, to prevent famine and pestilence, to feed the starving and warm the cold?</p>
      <p>But no one ever asks how your knees feel, or wonder how long it takes to walk down that mountain path from your magical fortress. Your poor, enchanted pack mule, Eldemere, is almost five hundred years old, for goodness's sake.</p>
      <p>But no matter. You've heard word of the terrible goings-on in the lands below your magical fortress. Perhaps it's been too long since you visited civilization.</p>
      <p>You make your way out of Mount Awful's foothills into the flatlands, where you can already hear the clashing of small swords in petty squabbles. The sun is high above, near it's zenith. You begin walking, and by the time you reach the town of Bilderberry, you realize you haven't eaten since breakfast. Making your way into the town, you stop by the Inn, seeking a small snack. Vegetable stew, perhaps.</p>
      <p>"Greetings, young man. I have an old ass in need of feeding. And my mule outside is hungry, too," you say with a chuckle. The Innkeeper stares at you blankly. "Quite famished," you offer with a smile.</p>
      <p>"I beg your patience, good sir. We are in the beginnings of a siege, and our facilities are stretched beyond their normal capacities."</p>
      <p>A siege? You think back to the thoudsands of armored dwarves surrounding the city, as you approached Bilderberry. Perhaps this is the sort of thing people always complain about, you think, as you sigh.</p>
      <p>Walking back outside, you leave Eldemere with the stable boy, and make your way back out the city gate to the forces preparing to attack.</p>
      <p>"Excuse me," you say, tapping a dwarf on his armored pauldron. "I'd like to speak to your leader, please." You're met with a sneer you very much do not appreciate, and insist again that you speak to whoever calls themself captain of this regiment.</p>
      <p>"I am these good dwarves leader. I am called Sneed, and we are here to-"</p>
      <p>"Very good. Do you intend to put this town under siege, and then attack them?"</p>
      <p>"We do," Sneed answers with narrowing eyes. "Perhaps you should make haste away from the castle, good si-"</p>
      <p>Silece falls over the camp as Sneed disappears from view. Looking down, you look at a frog witting amongst Sneed's previously-occupied plate armor. A dozen men pick up swords, and step toward you. They too disappear, as a quiet chorus of ribbits fill the camp. A dozen frogs begin hopping around, free of their armor.</p>
      <p>"Is that all?" you ask pleasantly, looking around at the pale-faced dwarves, glancing from you to the frogs hopping to and fro, then to you again. "I'll take that as a yes."</p>
      <p>There is no movement from the camp until you say, "Perhaps it's time everyone heads home?" and are met with an enthusiastic rush from thousands of dwarves all taking what they can carry, and running away on foot.</p>
      <p>You walk back into Bilderberry, petting Eldemere the Mule as you pass her by, walking into the Inn. "Young man, I would like some vegetable stew. Quite famished, you see."</p>
      <p>THE END.</p>
