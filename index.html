          <p>“Look, Dad! What's that dark cloud over there? It's not the storm, is it?” Looking over the backs of the
          four horses that pull your cart, your father squints, then says, “Riders. Lots of them and coming fast.”
          “Are they bandits, Paul?” asks your mother fearfully, clutching her shawl to her throat. “No, Martha.
          They can't be bandits. The Dwarven Guard cleaned up the last of them then years ago. I don't know
          who they are, but the way they're riding we'll soon find out. “Galen, grab that puppy of yours and get
          under cover in that pile of bedclothes.” “But I want to stay here. If there's trouble, I can help too.” “Do
          as your father says,” snaps your mother. “And don't come out till we say it's safe.” You know better
          than to argue with your mother, so you get off the narrow wooden seat and wriggle through the
          crowded cart. “Well, no one said I couldn't watch,” you whisper to Woofy, who licks your face in reply.
          Snuggling down into the pile of blankets, you quiet the puppy, who thinks you're trying to play. Then
          you arrange the blankets so that you can see. Soon, a faint rumble becomes the drumming thunder of
          horses' hoofs. “Hold your team!” demands a harsh voice. “Oh, Paul! It's the Guard!” cries your mother.
          “Thank heavens, we're safe.” Pulling the team to a complete stop, your father calls, “Ho! Guard! What
          is your business with us? We are anxious to camp before the storm breaks. Speak, and let us be on our
          way.” “Do you dare to speak so to the King's Guard?” snarls a menacing voice. “Teach the humans to
          be polite!” urges another of the uniformed dwarves. Your mother clings to your father's arm. Train
          begins to fall. All around you are the sounds of horses. Saddle leather creaks beneath the weight of the
          armored Dwarven Guard, and you feel the presence of unseen riders closing in. “Now, now, lads. Is this
          any way to speak to those we have vowed to protect?” asks a honeyed voice. “Come, let us not be
          hasty. Let's find out how the situation lies. After all, lads, we wouldn't want to make a mistake now,
          would we?” There is a long moment of silence. Then a few voices mutter, “Sneed's right.” “Well, then.
          There we all are. Nice and pleasant,” says Sneed. “Surely all a mistake. But these are lads with quick
          tempers, so please humor us by answering a few questions.” “I'm sure we've done no wrong,” says your
          mother. “What do you want to know?” “Just a few questions, “says Sneed. “Like where you've been
          and where you're going.” “Why, Captain, we're going to the prince's coronation, of course. And as to
          where we've been, we've been mapping. My husband is the royal mapmaker.” “Royal mapmaker, eh?
          Splendid occupation. So useful. And are you traveling alone?” Your father answers quickly, “Yes,
          Captain, quite alone. Just me and the missus.” “All by yourselves. Splendid, just splendid,” Sneed
          beams. “You see, lads, what comes of talking first? Now we know who these fine people are. Avoid
          mistakes, I always say. Now we know they are alone. Seize them!” Before your father can protest,
          heavy hands pull him and your mother from the cart. Your mother screams and your father curses, but
          rough laughter drowns out their cries. “You see, lads. It is as I told you. Who would suspect the king's
          own Dwarven Guard of treachery? No one, until it's far too late. Soon, all that is owed to us for long
          years of protecting humans will be ours. Now, tie these two up. We'll take them back to the caves. A
          mapmaker will be useful to our new kingdom. Soon we will launch our attack, With the price in our
          hands, the kingdom is ours! Drive the wagon int othe rocks and search it for gold and maps. Then burn
          it!”</p>

  <p>Better go find some adults, who will act selflessly and assist you with the power of altruism. Instead, you encounter a boy your age, who somehow possesses a raft and is equally as confident in his ability to solve deep-seated, decades long political unrest and social distress, bubbling up to the surface in the form of war. A solution is clearly in sight, if you can trust him.</p>
  <button id="trustSandy" onclick="grownUps86(this.id)">Trust this strange boy and take him at his word.</button>
  <button id="rejectSandy" onclick="grownUps86(this.id)">Even in times like these, trusting strangers is dangerous. Better not risk it. He may just hold you back.</button>

<div id="riverPrince134">
  <p>What's the worst that could happen? You and Sandy set off to handle this thing. But you almost immediately encounter what is very clearly a black dragon, and in turn your likely doom, far sooner than you thought something like this might happen. Like ever.</p>
  <button id="turnAround" onclick="riverPrince134(this.id)">Nope! Nope. No. Dealing with dwarves head-on is better than this. No, sir. Nope. Not today.</button>
  <button id="fightDragon" onclick="riverPrince134(this.id)">Even a large enemy can be felled if taken by surprise. Sharpen the raft's oar, flex your grown-up muscles, and charge its blindside!</button>
  <button id="avoidDragon" onclick="riverPrince134(this.id)">There is a gap in the rocks under the dragon. You can probably fit, and if you're a little lucky the dragon won't wake up.</button>
  <button id="carryRaft" onclick="riverPrince134(this.id)">Burdened with an unusual sense of consequence, you decide to carry your raft down the bank of the river. Take the long way around to avoid that big fella.</button>
</div>

<div id="pastDragon141">
  <p>After an afternoon of you two hauling a raft around on land and contemplating how that's exactly opposite of how rafts are supposed to work, you and Sandy are finally out of the enormous dragon's sight. You find a bend in the river to put the raft back into water, secure it with some rope, and set up camp. That night, as you sleep, you feel a tickle in your ear. Waking up, you find yourself covered in snakes longer than your pa is tall. Dang.
  <button id="rollIntoRiver" onclick="rightRiverBank141(this.id)">There's nothing snakes hate more than water. Roll into the river and get them off of you! Did pa ever get around to teaching you to swim?</button>
  <button id="rollIntoEmbers" onclick="rightRiverBank141(this.id)">Or is it fire that they hate? Your campfire is still smoldering bright in the night. A few leaves tumble down and ignite as they touch the red-hot charcoals. Is diving onto a campfire better than jumping into a rushing river?</button>
  <button id="confused" onclick="rightRiverBank141(this.id)">This is really too much. You don't know what to do.</button>
</div>

<div id="riverSnakes93">
  <p>That was terrible. Just as you begin to wonder if your misery is a device of your own making, a new, small noise catches your ear. Sandy comes running up with a burning branch and one singed eyebrow. He chased off the rest of the snakes with a burning branch. For a moment, you wish you had thought of that. You ask him if he can hear a peculiar chittering, but he doesn't hear it. Maybe it's your imagination after a snake tongue tickled your eardrum a few minutes ago.</p><p>Nope! It's swamp rats, absolutely everywhere.</p>
  <button id="jumpInRiver" onclick="grownUps86(this.id)">Jumping in the river isn't always an option, but it's mighty handy (if possibly repetitive) right now. But you can't depend on others forever, and someday you'll have to learn to fight your own battles, too.</button>

</div>

<div id="swimForIt66">
  <p>The water carries you down again, the swamp rats clawing and gnawing at you in a panic. They're tossed away in the current, as you bounce off large stones, stronger than the current. You knew if you went to the well too many times, it would come back to bite you. Going to the well too many times, and the swamp rats, both.</p><p>Minutes later, you wash up on shore, sore and winded, but alive. A few minutes more pass before a one-eyebrowed Sandy drifts up in his raft. You climb on just in time to see a mass of white fur in the water, as the swamp rats have gathered together to better float toward you. Taking a loose branch, you help Sandy push off as fast as you can, and soon the white mass of fur in the water grows smaller and smaller, and is soon a distant memory.</p>
  <p>But ahead, you hear the roar of a waterfall, and you rue this relentless, cursed life.</p>
  <button id="jumpLeft" onclick="waterFall70(this.id)">Take on the waterfall, driving the draft off the left edge into the mist, like an invincible creature with no concept of fear or mortality.</button>
  <button id="jumpRight" onclick="waterFall70(this.id)">Or go to the right, which may or may not be totally different than the left side of the watefall. It's not the destination, it's the journey.</button>
  <button id="goToIsland" onclick="waterFall70(this.id)">There is a suspiciously peaceful-looking island in the center of the river. You feel yourself growing more and more into a cynical adult every moment as it grows larger, realizing nothing is this easy, and it's more likely the gods might be testing you than a satisfying solution might present itself so readily.</button>
</div>
<div id="islandProspects18">
  <p>Despite your best judgment, fear of the waterfall drives you to the island. Crashing your raft into the point, you and Sandy clamber up onto the slick-stone shore. No sooner do you gain your footing than the entire island lurches to the side, knocking you over. Ahead of you, an enormous head rises up out of the water and turns to you, its enormous eyes peering down at you. The island begins to look more like a shell by the moment, as its enormous beak clacks and it lets out a shriek that sends you rolling backwards.</p>
  <p>You scream for Sandy to run for it, and the two of you dive back on your raft, landing in the rapids just as the monster disappears from view. Moments pass before it rises back up, facing you this time, you raft drifting closer and closer to the waterfall.</p>
  <button id="waterfall" onclick="islandThing18(this.id)">Test your fate and take your raft off the waterfall.</button>
  <button id="giantSteps84" onclick="islandThing18(this.id)">As you round the subtle bend toward the waterfall, you see how the river splits in two, toward giant steps, rushing down in rapids.</button>
  <button id="monsterChat" onclick="islandThing18(this.id)">You've had enough. You make an intimidation check against the castle-sized snapping turtle.</button>
</div>

<div id="waterFallJumpLeft147">
  <p>The immensity of your bad idea is cushioned by the waterfall not really being that bad. You fall off the ledge and plunge into a warm-water lagoon, your raft and Sandy landing several feet away and bobbing to the surface.</p>
  <p>As Sandy bobs up to the surface, he lets out a shriek that would be the envy of any passing bird of prey. Looking down, you see large, green humanoid hands reaching up out of the water. Panicking and doggy paddling away, you look back and see six lizardmen with royal armor of sorts, looking you in the eye. They invite you into their lair, where they would like to warm you, feed you, and hear your story.</p>
  <p>Just as you agree, you see Sandy climbing out of the lagoon and running off into the trees at a full sprint. You call for him once, then decide he's probably had enough for one adventure, and turn away. Between facing the monster in the river, and going over the waterfall, you feel yourself flush with a newfound confidence. You hold your head high as you follow the lizardguard around the waterfall and into their laier in the mountain side.</p>
  <p>Inside, you are fed a steaming tincture that burns your mouth, and seems to eat through your very being. But soon you are healed of your injuries and pains from the previous day. You think back on everything you've seen, and this is relatively desirable. They hear your tale, and offer to strike down your enemies in exchange for a hearing with the prince, hoping to establish trade and raise the economic prospects for their people.</p>
  <button id="trustLizardmen" onclick="trustLizard(this.id)">You trust the lizardmen and their offer to help you defeat your foes. Of course they can speak to your prince, who you yourself would otherwise not be able to speak to. It will probably work out fine.</button>
  <button id="neverTrustLizardmen" onclick="trustLizard(this.id)">Who are they kidding? Everyone knows Lizardmen are prohibitively dishonest. They're probably just trying to lull you into a false sense of security, so they can eat you. Which they couldn't just do right now if they wanted. It's better to not think about that sort of thing.</button>
</div>

<div id="giantSteps84">
  <p>This was an absolutely terrible idea. Every fall of ten or more feet rattles your very core, and shakes your raft apart. By the third step, the bindings around the logs are coming undone. By the fifth, you are scrambling to hold onto a single log. Sandy screams and disappears into the white waters, and you are plunged into the depths, swept completely out of control as you lose grip on your log and tumble through the water defenselessly.</p>
  <p>As you hit the bottom, you float in the lagoon and peer up at the waterfall that, in retrospect, wasn't that bad. Something stings above your eye, but you hardly feel it, uncomprehending.</p>
  <p>Then, from the depths of the water around you, immensely powerful, green humanoid hands reach up and grab you, lifting you up and carrying you into a cave behind the waterfall.</p>
  <p>Inside, you are fed a steaming tincture that burns your mouth, and seems to eat through your very being. But soon you are awake and fully aware, surrounded by lizard men. You think back on your day, and everything you've seen, and this is relatively desirable. They hear your tale, and offer to strike down your enemies in exchange for a hearing with the prince, hoping to establish trade and raise the economic prospects for their people.</p>

</div>

<div id="attackDragon49">
  <p>You sharpen the raft's oar to a brutal point and sneak up on the slumbering beast. It does not occur to you what sort of creature might sleep out in the open, totally alone and unguarded. Letting out a primal, ten-year-old scream, you charge with your makeshift spear. It shatters on contact, splintering into pieces against the armor scales of the beast. You have only a moment to think before it twitches in its sleep, the impact sending you across the width of the river, landing in the silt and mud of the riverbank. As you slowly lose consciousness, you consider that, perhaps, that was a terrible idea and you've thrown away your one chance to save your parents, and your country, from the impending dwarf attack.</p> -->

          <p>“I don't really think I can help you,” you tell the old dwarf.</p>
          <p>At your words, his shoulders sag, and he seems to age before your very eyes. “no, I suppose it was too much to hope for,” sighs the dwarf. “Well, come with me. I will show you where your parents are.”</p>
          <p>You follow the bent form to a cell in a nearby tunnel. The door is heavily barred, but the dwarf helps you, and soon the door creaks open.</p>
          <p>Your parents hurry out. “Oh, Galen,” cries your mother, flinging her arms around you. “I thought you were dead. I thought we'd never see you again.”</p>
          <p>“Now, Martha,” says your father gruffly, “don't smother the child.” Yet when your mother loosens her hold, your father squeezes your arm hard and there are tears in his eyes.</p>
          <p>“No time for reunions,” grumbles the dwarf. “Time for that later...if you live.” You follow him closely as he shuffles through the corridors. Soon you reach an unguarded exit and escape into the night. You and your parents hide in the hills.</p>
          <p>In the morning you watch the mounted dwarven army ride out. As evening's shadows lengthen on the mountains, the army returns, victorious. Over the years, you and your parents live under the grim rule of the evil monarch Sneed the Supreme. You often wonder what would have happened if you had helped the dwarf.</p>

          <p>The old dwarf tries hard to convince you that he is an enemy of the evil Sneed, but you are too scared and tired to even listen. The old dwarf finally accepts the fact he has lost. Sagging with defeat, he sinks to the floor and, wrapping his arms around his knees, mumbles softly to himself.</p>
          <p>Early the next morning you are awakened by the sound of thousands of dwarves marching off to battle. The old dwarf stand forlornly at the mouth of the empty cavern, listening to them go. A thread of doubt creeps into your mind, and you wonder if maybe, just maybe, you made the wrong decision.</p>

          <p>Cautiously you edge into the left-hand tunnel. The sound of rushing water grows louder. You are trying to move with care when suddenly your hands slip on a patch of slick moss. You fee yourself beginning to slide. All at once, the pipe ends and you drop through cold, dark space. Splash! You plunge deep into switftly flowing icy water that seizes you in its powerful current and whirls you away.</p>
          <p>You have fallen into the great underground river that flows beneath the city.</p>
          <p>you are pushed along by the fierce current and deposited, bruised and battered, on the banks of he river as it surfaces miles beyond the walls of the city.</p>
          <p>You crawl up into the muddy bank. You lie there panting and trying to think. You could walk back to the city and maybe still help. You could also try to walk back to the caves and free your parents while most of the dwarves are gone. But either way, you realize, you are probably too late to save the prince.</p>

          <p>“It’s just some dumb kid, and a dog. Got themselves stuck in the drain,” says the dwarf., and soon the battle rages on again. You try to get someone to help, but no one listens. After a long time, all is silent.</p>
          <p>You hear steps in the silence, then a bearded face peers through the grade. It’s Sneed!</p>

        <p>“It’s not our fight, Galen. Don’t get involved,” says your mother.  “Maybe you’re right,” you say and grasping your mother’s hand, you lead her out into the dark corridor After long hours of bumbling about in the dark, you find yourself outside, standing on top of the iron-red cliffs.</p>
        <p>Below you, the dwarves army returns victorious.</p>

          <p>Pulling the horses into the trees at the edge of the road, you hide and wait until thundering hoofs and booming war drums announce Sneed’s arrival.  “Open the gates!” roars Sneed.</p>
          <p>“Go away! It’s not the time!” yells the guard.</p>
          <p>“Open the gate or it will be past time for your head to rest on your neck,” snarls Sneed.</p>
          <p>There is a moment’s silence, and then the guard says in a tiny voice, “Oh, maybe it is time after all. I think I see the sun coming up now.” The large wooden gates creak open, and Sneed and his men thunder through into the sleeping city.</p>
          <p>As soon as the last Dwarf passes through the gates, the three of you mount your horses and follow them. The gate guard glowers own at you and mutters angrily to himself.</p>
          <p>As you creep through the empty city streets, you hear the army roar, “Sneed! Sneed! Sneed! Long live Sneed the Supreme!”</p>
          <p>Suddenly there is a clatter of hoofs and three horses dash by you. Ties to the saddle of one of the horses ia  boy no older than yourself. A small crown rests crookedly on his head and tears streak his cheeks. For one short moment, the boy looks into your eyes—his look filled with despair—and then he is gone.</p>
          <p>Just then, a small bent figure walks by the alley where you are hiding. He rubs his thin hands together and chuckles to himself, “At last, the king is dead, his son captured, soon to be in a dwarves cell, and those meddlesome Boulderbenders out of the way. Now all I have to do is let Sneed rule for a little while. When the time is right, I’ll slip a poison mushroom into the stew. Then it’s King Snively! No more ‘Yes, sir. No, sir’ ever again.”</p>
          <p>“Not if I can help it,” you say, leaping out of the alley. Before Snively can say another word, you bang him on top of the head with a large rock and he falls to the ground with a thud. You drag him into the alley, search his pockets, and discover a large ring of keys.</p>
          <p>“Bork, do you recognize these keys?”</p>
           <p>“Of course. They’re the keys to the dungeon cells,” answers Bork.</p>
          <p>“I thought he’d have them,” you say. “Help me tie him up. I think we should ride back to the caves, rescue the prince and my parents from the prisons, and throw Snively into the deepest dungeon.”</p>
          <p>“It will also give me a chance to talk to my warriors. Once they know I am free, they will revolt. By morning Iron Mountain will be ours and your parents and the prince will be free and safe.”</p>
          <p>Happily, you turn and ride toward the caves in the mountains.</p>
