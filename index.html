          <p>“I don't really think I can help you,” you tell the old dwarf.</p>
          <p>At your words, his shoulders sag, and he seems to age before your very eyes. “no, I suppose it was too much to hope for,” sighs the dwarf. “Well, come with me. I will show you where your parents are.”</p>
          <p>You follow the bent form to a cell in a nearby tunnel. The door is heavily barred, but the dwarf helps you, and soon the door creaks open.</p>
          <p>Your parents hurry out. “Oh, Galen,” cries your mother, flinging her arms around you. “I thought you were dead. I thought we'd never see you again.”</p>
          <p>“Now, Martha,” says your father gruffly, “don't smother the child.” Yet when your mother loosens her hold, your father squeezes your arm hard and there are tears in his eyes.</p>
          <p>“No time for reunions,” grumbles the dwarf. “Time for that later...if you live.” You follow him closely as he shuffles through the corridors. Soon you reach an unguarded exit and escape into the night. You and your parents hide in the hills.</p>
          <p>In the morning you watch the mounted dwarven army ride out. As evening's shadows lengthen on the mountains, the army returns, victorious. Over the years, you and your parents live under the grim rule of the evil monarch Sneed the Supreme. You often wonder what would have happened if you had helped the dwarf.</p>

          <p>“No! Why should I trust you?” you exclaim. “You're a dwarf! This is probably a trick to get me killed. Go away!”</p>
          <p>The old dwarf tries hard to convince you that he is an enemy of the evil Sneed, but you are too scared and tired to even listen. The old dwarf finally accepts the fact he has lost. Sagging with defeat, he sinks to the floor and, wrapping his arms around his knees, mumbles softly to himself.</p>
          <p>Early the next morning you are awakened by the sound of thousands of dwarves marching off to battle. The old dwarf stand forlornly at the mouth of the empty cavern, listening to them go. A thread of doubt creeps into your mind, and you wonder if maybe, just maybe, you made the wrong decision.</p>

          <p>Cautiously you edge into the left-hand tunnel. The sound of rushing water grows louder. You are trying to move with care when suddenly your hands slip on a patch of slick moss. You fee yourself beginning to slide. All at once, the pipe ends and you drop through cold, dark space. Splash! You plunge deep into switftly flowing icy water that seizes you in its powerful current and whirls you away.</p>
          <p>You have fallen into the great underground river that flows beneath the city.</p>
          <p>you are pushed along by the fierce current and deposited, bruised and battered, on the banks of he river as it surfaces miles beyond the walls of the city.</p>
          <p>You crawl up into the muddy bank. You lie there panting and trying to think. You could walk back to the city and maybe still help. You could also try to walk back to the caves and free your parents while most of the dwarves are gone. But either way, you realize, you are probably too late to save the prince.</p>

          <p>“It’s just some dumb kid, and a dog. Got themselves stuck in the drain,” says the dwarf., and soon the battle rages on again. You try to get someone to help, but no one listens. After a long time, all is silent.</p>
          <p>You hear steps in the silence, then a bearded face peers through the grade. It’s Sneed!</p>
          <p>“Ah, there you are. I must admit, it’s grand seeing you behind bars. I want you to know I’m going to do my best to keep things that way, now that I’m king.”</p>

        <p>As much as you want to, you cannot leave your mother in tears.</p>
        <p>“Well, maybe it will be all right. Maybe the boulder benders will be able to warn the prince in time,” you say with a sigh.</p>
        <p>“It’s not our fight, Galen. Don’t get involved,” says your mother.  “Maybe you’re right,” you say and grasping your mother’s hand, you lead her out into the dark corridor After long hours of bumbling about in the dark, you find yourself outside, standing on top of the iron-red cliffs.</p>
        <p>Below you, the dwarves army returns victorious.</p>
        <p>Years later, as apprentice mapmaker to Sneed the Supreme, you wonder for the millionth time if you made a mistake in not going with Bork and Hume. If so, perhaps you will get a chance to correct that mistake. You have been contacted by Bork the Second, and you have agreed to help overthrow the evil Sneed. This time you will succeed.</p>

          <p>Pulling the horses into the trees at the edge of the road, you hide and wait until thundering hoofs and booming war drums announce Sneed’s arrival.  “Open the gates!” roars Sneed.</p>
          <p>“Go away! It’s not the time!” yells the guard.</p>
          <p>“Open the gate or it will be past time for your head to rest on your neck,” snarls Sneed.</p>
          <p>There is a moment’s silence, and then the guard says in a tiny voice, “Oh, maybe it is time after all. I think I see the sun coming up now.” The large wooden gates creak open, and Sneed and his men thunder through into the sleeping city.</p>
          <p>As soon as the last Dwarf passes through the gates, the three of you mount your horses and follow them. The gate guard glowers own at you and mutters angrily to himself.</p>
          <p>As you creep through the empty city streets, you hear the army roar, “Sneed! Sneed! Sneed! Long live Sneed the Supreme!”</p>
          <p>Suddenly there is a clatter of hoofs and three horses dash by you. Ties to the saddle of one of the horses ia  boy no older than yourself. A small crown rests crookedly on his head and tears streak his cheeks. For one short moment, the boy looks into your eyes—his look filled with despair—and then he is gone.</p>
          <p>Just then, a small bent figure walks by the alley where you are hiding. He rubs his thin hands together and chuckles to himself, “At last, the king is dead, his son captured, soon to be in a dwarves cell, and those meddlesome Boulderbenders out of the way. Now all I have to do is let Sneed rule for a little while. When the time is right, I’ll slip a poison mushroom into the stew. Then it’s King Snively! No more ‘Yes, sir. No, sir’ ever again.”</p>
          <p>“Not if I can help it,” you say, leaping out of the alley. Before Snively can say another word, you bang him on top of the head with a large rock and he falls to the ground with a thud. You drag him into the alley, search his pockets, and discover a large ring of keys.</p>
          <p>“Bork, do you recognize these keys?”</p>
           <p>“Of course. They’re the keys to the dungeon cells,” answers Bork.</p>
          <p>“I thought he’d have them,” you say. “Help me tie him up. I think we should ride back to the caves, rescue the prince and my parents from the prisons, and throw Snively into the deepest dungeon.”</p>
          <p>“It will also give me a chance to talk to my warriors. Once they know I am free, they will revolt. By morning Iron Mountain will be ours and your parents and the prince will be free and safe.”</p>
          <p>Happily, you turn and ride toward the caves in the mountains.</p>

          <p>He picks you up, laughs loudly, and thumps you on the top of the head with a heavy fist. Your mother screams, and everything goes black. Maybe you will recover and be able to help your parents escape later, but for now, it's ...</p>
